# HTML Basics

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. It's the foundation of every web page and provides the structure for displaying text, images, links, and other resources in a browser.

## HTML Structure

HTML documents are structured using tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`). A basic HTML structure consists of the following elements:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>

<!DOCTYPE html>: Defines the document type and version of HTML being used.
<html>: The root element that encloses all other HTML elements.
<head>: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title and links to external resources.
<title>: Sets the title of the web page displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
<body>: Contains the visible content of the web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
<h1>: Represents the highest level of heading. Use <h2> to <h6> for lower levels.
Tags and Elements
HTML consists of a wide variety of tags and elements that define the structure and content of a web page. Some commonly used tags include:

<p>: Defines a paragraph.
<a>: Creates a hyperlink.
<img>: Embeds an image.
<ul> and <ol>: Define unordered and ordered lists, respectively.
<li>: Represents a list item within a list.
<div>: Defines a division or container for grouping content.
<span>: Used to apply styles or scripting to a specific portion of text.
<table>: Creates a table.
<form>: Defines an HTML form for user input.
Attributes
HTML tags can have attributes that provide additional information about the element. For example:
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">

href: Specifies the URL of a link.
src: Specifies the source (URL or file path) of an image.
alt: Provides alternative text for images (important for accessibility).
